Welcome to the NLP Hub! Our platform is dedicated to exploring the vast and intricate landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is a field at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics, focusing on the interaction between computers and human languages.

The diagram above, sourced from [NLP Planet](https://www.nlplanet.org/), illustrates various NLP tasks. Here, we delve into key functions essential for understanding and leveraging NLP:

* **Text Analysis**: This involves examining the structure and meaning of textual data. Understanding syntax and semantics is crucial for deeper insights. Learn more about text analysis in Steven Bird's book *Natural Language Processing with Python* and [this guide](https://neptune.ai/blog/tokenization-in-nlp).
* **Sentiment Analysis**: Categorizing text based on sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) is essential for understanding public opinion and customer feedback. For a deeper dive, check out [this detailed article](https://www.sketchengine.eu/penn-treebank-tagset/).
* **Text Similarity**: Measuring how similar two pieces of text are can be useful in plagiarism detection and document clustering. Explore different algorithms in [this informative post](https://www.newscatcherapi.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-text-similarity-with-python#toc-3).
* **Keyword Extraction**: Identifying significant words and phrases helps in indexing and summarization. Understand the methods in [this tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/keyword-extraction-process-in-python-with-natural-language-processing-nlp-d769a9069d5c).
* **Topic Modeling**: Discovering hidden themes within large text datasets is invaluable for organizing and understanding information. Learn about topic modeling [here](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/what-is-topic-modeling).
* **Text Summarization**: Automatically generating concise summaries makes large volumes of text more digestible. Read more on text summarization techniques in [this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/text-summarization-in-nlp/).
* **Language Translation**: Translating text between languages breaks down communication barriers. For insights into state-of-the-art models, see [this resource](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-translate-text-with-python-9d203139dcf5).
