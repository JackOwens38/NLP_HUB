### Mathematical Explanation of RAKE

RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction) is a keyword extraction algorithm that identifies key phrases in a body of text. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of how it works:

1. **Tokenization**: The text is split into words.
2. **Phrase Extraction**: Sequences of words that do not contain stop words are extracted as candidate keywords.
3. **Word Scores**: Each word is scored based on its frequency and degree (number of times it appears in candidate keywords).
4. **Phrase Scores**: Candidate keywords are scored by summing the scores of their constituent words.

The score of a word \( w \) is calculated as:

st.latex(r'''
\text{Where:}
\begin{align*}
\text{Frequency}(w) & \text{ is the number of occurrences of the word.} \\
\text{Degree}(w) & \text{ is the sum of the co-occurrences of the word with other words.}
